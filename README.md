# Basic Stata Coding

## This repository includes all the example and demonstration code that I write for the "Basic Coding in Stata" series [at my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuqqFqdVYNIwXjpxlLgi5vQW6V7roXtox)

* this is the remake of my Stata programming lectures and tutorials at S1 and S2, 2020. 
* my purpose is to use this series as a step-by-step guidance for Stata coding introduction; hence, I make it long and include all the possible steps, intuitions and explanations.
* my goal is, hopefully, to give a a comprehensive idea on the fundamental workflow of Stata programming
